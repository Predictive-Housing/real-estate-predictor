### Tax Rate vs. Appreciation Correlation Analysis

**Key Finding**: There appears to be an **inverse correlation** between property tax rates and home value appreciation in Westchester County.

**Evidence**:
1. **Mount Kisco** - Lowest tax rate (1.39%) but below-average appreciation (5.11% annual)
2. **Armonk** - Low tax rate (2.01%) but modest appreciation (5.59% annual) 
3. **Chappaqua** - Higher tax rate (2.69%) but below-average appreciation (3.82% annual)
4. **Pleasantville** - Mid-range tax rate (~2.35%) but below-average appreciation (4.82% annual)
5. **Croton-on-Hudson** - Highest tax rate (6.14%) but shows strong long-term growth since 2000

**Possible Explanations**:
- **School District Quality**: Mount Kisco is part of Bedford Central School District (ranked 226th of 865 NY districts), which may impact appreciation despite low taxes
- **Value Already Priced In**: Lower tax areas may have those savings already reflected in higher initial home prices
- **Market Saturation**: Higher-priced markets (Armonk, Chappaqua) may have less room for growth
- **Investment Opportunity**: Some high-tax areas like Croton-on-Hudson may have been undervalued, creating appreciation potential

**Notable Exception**: Croton-on-Hudson's 6.14% tax rate hasn't deterred strong long-term appreciation, suggesting other factors (location, community, services) outweigh tax concerns.

**Conclusion**: While tax rates are important, they don't appear to be the primary driver of home value appreciation in Westchester County. Location, school quality, commute times, and community amenities likely play larger roles in determining property values and appreciation rates.
